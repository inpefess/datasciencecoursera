I used [this web-page](http://topepo.github.io/caret/training.html) for `caret` examples and GBM as a model because Owen Zhang [recommends](http://www.slideshare.net/freshdatabos/zhang-winning-datasciencecompetitions) it for simple modelling when you don't know what to better do instead.

First, I defined libraries used (`caret` surprisingly:)) and loaded data.
```{r, echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
library(caret)
data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
```
